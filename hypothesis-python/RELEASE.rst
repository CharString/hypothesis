RELEASE_TYPE: patch

This release adds the experimental and unstable |OBSERVABILITY_CHOICE_NODES| option for :ref:`observability <observability>`, which includes the choice sequence in ``metadata.choice_nodes`` for test case observations if set.

We are actively working towards a better interface for this. Feel free to use |OBSERVABILITY_CHOICE_NODES| to experiment, but don't rely on it yet!
