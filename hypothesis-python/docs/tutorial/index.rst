Tutorial
========

The Hypothesis tutorial introduces the main features of Hypothesis. We suggest reading through in order until completing :doc:`/tutorial/adapting-strategies`, at which point you can choose to read what seems interesting to you.

If you're in a hurry, the :doc:`quickstart </quickstart>` is a much faster bare-bones version.
